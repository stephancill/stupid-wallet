# Swift Guidelines

- Prefer clear, descriptive naming; explicit types on public APIs.
- Use guard clauses and early returns; avoid deep nesting.
- Keep UI state in `@StateObject`/`@Published` and drive views from state.
- Bridge PromiseKit to async/await using a small extension when needed.
- Store selected address in `UserDefaults(suiteName: <AppGroup>)` key `walletAddress`.
- The native extension handler should:
  - Read the address from the shared App Group.
  - Implement `eth_requestAccounts` and `eth_accounts` returning `[address]` or `[]`.
  - Log minimally and never include sensitive data.

Security & Key Management:

- Use Dawn Key Management to encrypt and store private keys. Never expose raw keys to JS.
- Implement consent flows before signing; do not auto-approve.
